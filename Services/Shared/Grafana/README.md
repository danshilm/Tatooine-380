## EmbyToVarken 
It's to have `current streams` on Grafana as what Varken does for Plex, but for Emby too since they don't support it.


## FolderSizeMonitoring 
It's to have the Disks -> Storage Space pie chart shown [here](../../Monitoring/grafana/README.md).


## SmartHddMonitoring
It is still a wip (it will be to analyse SMART attributes of HDDs to deduce which might be failing based on a number of those attributes).
